  <p>
    We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how Tamil Kavithai ("we", "us", or "our")
    collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards information when you use our website or services.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We may collect information that you provide directly (for example, when you contact us) and information that is collected automatically (for example,
    analytics and diagnostic data). Examples include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact information you provide (email address, name) when you reach out.</li>
    <li>Device and usage information (IP address, browser type, operating system, pages visited, timestamps) collected through analytics tools.</li>
    <li>Cookies and similar technologies (see below).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use the information to operate and improve our services, respond to requests, prevent abuse and fraud, and for analytics and security. We will not
    sell your personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    We use cookies and similar technologies to provide and improve our services. You can control cookie preferences in your browser. Third-party services
    we use (analytics, hosting) may also set cookies; please consult their privacy policies for details.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We may use third-party services (for example, analytics, hosting, and payment providers) that collect information about your use of the service. These
    providers process data according to their own privacy policies. Links to some providers we use:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Log Data and Diagnostics</h2>
  <p>
    When the service experiences errors, we (and our service providers) may collect diagnostic data such as crash reports, device identifiers, and usage logs to
    help us identify and fix issues.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over
    the internet or electronic storage is completely secure—absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    Our services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have
    collected information from a child, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes we will update the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the service
    after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>
